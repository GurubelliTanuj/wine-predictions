# wine-quality-prediction
Prediction of Wine Quality using various features like critic acid, volatile acidity,pH, alcohol and so on. In this Project, two Supervised Learning algorithm Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine is used and results are compared.

Steps Involved
1 Import Libraries

2 EDA

3 Data Cleaning

4 Data preparation

5 Implement Model

6 Evaluation

Tools used
1 Numpy

2 Pandas

3 scikit learn

4 matplotlib

5 seaborn

Conclusion
Based on the bar plots plotted we come to an conclusion that not all input features are essential and affect the data, for example from the bar plot against quality and citric acid shows that quality of wine increases with increase in critic acid and bar plot against quality and volatile acidity is inveresly proportional

For classifying the wine quality, we have implemented 2 algorithms, namely

Support Vector Classifier

Random Forest

We were able to achieve maximum accuracy using random forest of 92%.SVC has an accuracy of 85%.
